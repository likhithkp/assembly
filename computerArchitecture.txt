### Introduction to CPU-RAM Communication

In a computer system, the central processing unit (CPU) communicates with the random-access memory (RAM) to perform various operations. This communication occurs through a set of pathways called buses.

Buses:
- Control Bus: Manages control signals for read/write commands and acknowledgments.
- Address Bus: Sends memory addresses from the CPU to the RAM (uni-directional).
- Data Bus: Transfers data between the CPU and RAM (half-duplex).

Process Overview:
1. Read Operation:
   - The CPU sends a read request via the control bus.
   - It specifies the memory address using the address bus.
   - The RAM retrieves the requested data and sends it back to the CPU via the data bus.
   - An acknowledgment signal is sent from the RAM to the CPU through the control bus.

2. Write Operation:
   - The CPU sends a write request via the control bus.
   - It specifies the memory address and data to be written using the address and data buses.
   - The RAM writes the data at the specified address.
   - An acknowledgment signal is sent from the RAM to the CPU through the control bus.

Key Points:
- Half-Duplex Communication: Data transfer occurs one way at a time on the data bus.
- Memory Addresses: RAM is divided into memory addresses, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.
