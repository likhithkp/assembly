### Introduction to Registers in CPU

Registers are small, high-speed storage locations located directly inside the central processing unit (CPU). They play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of data processing and preventing data loss during computation.

Purpose
- Registers were introduced to address the limitation of data loss during CPU-RAM communication.
- They act as temporary storage locations for data during processing, ensuring quick access and manipulation.

Types of Registers
- General-Purpose Registers Versatile registers used for a wide range of tasks.
  - Examples include AX, BX, CX, and DX, each with its specific role.
  - AX (Accumulator): Used for arithmetic and logic operations.
  - BX (Base): Holds base addresses for accessing data structures.
  - CX (Counter): Used as a loop counter in iterative operations.
  - DX (Data): Stores overflowed bits during arithmetic operations.

Naming Convention
- Registers are named based on their size: AX for 16-bit, EAX for 32-bit, and RAX for 64-bit.
- They can be divided into high and low parts for efficient data handling.

Usage Examples
- AX is versatile, used for arithmetic, input/output, and general operations.
- BX often holds base addresses for data structures like arrays or linked lists.
- CX serves as a loop counter, facilitating iterative processes.
- DX acts as a backup for overflowed bits during arithmetic operations.

Registers are essential components of the CPU, ensuring efficient data processing and preventing loss or corruption of data during computation.
